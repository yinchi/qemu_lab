//! The user heap: a `#[global_allocator]` over the program break (`brk`), so a program can use `alloc`
//! (`Vec`, `String`, `Box`, ...). Built only with the `heap` feature; a program that enables it gets it, and
//! one that does not links none of it.
//!
//! The heap starts empty and asks the kernel for memory *when an allocation does not fit*, not per
//! allocation: the first request maps a chunk (at least 64 KiB), and each later one grows by at least the
//! heap's current size (capped at 1 MiB per step, so a huge heap does not double past what is needed), so
//! a program that allocates a lot makes a handful of `brk` calls, not thousands. The bookkeeping -- free
//! lists, splitting, coalescing -- is `linked_list_allocator`'s `Heap`, the crate the kernel's own heap uses;
//! this module only decides when to call `brk`. A request the kernel refuses (the heap would run into the
//! stack's guard) is an allocation failure, which `alloc` turns into a panic and `panic` into `exit(101)`.
//!
//! Memory is never given back: `dealloc` returns blocks to the free list, and the break only moves up.
