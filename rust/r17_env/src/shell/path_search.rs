//! Where a bare command name is looked for: the directories of `$PATH`, in order. Pure `no_std` + `alloc`, so it is
//! tested on the host (`hosttests/`); `launch.rs` turns each candidate into a lookup.
//!
//! The rules:
//! - `PATH` **unset** means `/bin`, so a shell with no environment (or a test that sets none) finds the programs as
//!   it always has. **Set but empty** means no directory at all: nothing is found.
//! - The value is split at `:`. An **empty entry** (`a::b`, a leading or trailing `:`) is skipped: POSIX would search the
//!   working directory there, which is a good way to run the wrong program by accident.
//! - A **relative entry** (`bin`, `./tools`) is kept relative; the caller resolves it against the working directory
//!   when it looks, as bash does.
//! - In each directory the name is tried exactly as typed: `dir/name`. (Stages 11-16 also tried `dir/name.exe`, the
//!   Cygwin lookup order, with programs installed as `cat.exe`; from Stage 17 they are just `cat`.)
//! - A name containing `/` is a path and is never searched for: `launch.rs` handles it before asking here.
