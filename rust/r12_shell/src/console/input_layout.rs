//! cursor byte offset lands. The line discipline (`keyboard/line_discipline.rs`) uses it both to size
//! and place the input area, and to find the screen cell for the Step 12 cursor-aware editor's visible
//! cursor (`cursor_position`).
//!
//! It replays exactly what `Console::write_char` does, by driving the same `Cursor` (`cells.rs`) over
//! an endless screen -- a glyph that ends in the last column leaves the wrap pending, a wide glyph that
//! does not fit moves to the next row whole -- so the layout and the drawing cannot disagree. Text is
//! taken to be printable: the line buffer never holds control characters (`line.rs`), and the
//! prompt is plain text.
//!
//! Pure `no_std`, with no dependency on the rest of the kernel, so it is tested on the host
//! (`hosttests/`).
